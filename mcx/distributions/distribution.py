class Distribution(ABC):
    """Represents a probability distribution.

    A distribution is an object that can generate samples and to which a
    log-probability distribution function (logpdf) is associated.

    Keeping track of shapes during sampling is no easy task _[1]; we follow
    Tensorflow Distribution's shape system _[2,3] which decomposes shapes along
    three dimensions:

    - *sample_shape:* independent, identically distributed samples from the same
      distribution;
    - *batch_shape:* independent samples from different distributions;
    - *event_shape:* shape of a simple draw from a distribution;

    Each distribution is defined on a support, and trying to compute the logpdf
    outside of the support should return -infinity. We generally follow the
    design of Pytorch Distributions _[4] and define a set of constraints that
    return `True` when the input satisfies the contraint, `False` otherwise,
    and assign a constraint to the support. The `logpdf` method is wrapped by a
    decorator that checks whether arguments belong to the support.

    Attributes
    ----------
    params_constraints: Dict
        The constraints on the values of the parameters.
    support: Type[Constraint]
        The support of the logpdf.
    sample_shape: Tuple
        Describes independent, identically distributed samples from the same distribution _[TFD].
    batch_shape: Tuple
        Describes independant samples from different distributions _[TFD].
    event_shape: Tuple
        Shape of a single draw from the distribution _[TFD].
