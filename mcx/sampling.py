class sampler(object):
    """The linear sampling runtime.

    This runtime is encountered in every probabilistic programming library
    (PPL). It allows the user to fetch a pre-defined number of samples from the
    model's posterior distribution. The output is one or several chains that
    contain the successive samples from the posterior.

    While this is undoubtedly the fastest way to obtain samples, it comes at a
    cost in mosts PPLs: to obtain more samples one needs to re-run the inference
    entirely. In MCX the runtime keeps track of the chains' current state so
    that it is possible to get more samples:

        >>> trace = sampler.run()  # gives an initial 1,000 samples
        ... longer_trace = sample.run(5_000)
        ... final_trace = trace + longer_trace

    This runtime comes with two execution model: batch and iterative sampling.
    In the batch model, the one most PPL users are used to, we can fetch a set
    number of samples:

        >>> trace = sampler.run(1_000)

    Executing sampling this way returns a Trace object that contains both the
    samples and additional information about the sampling process. The iterative
    model allows you to fetch samples in a for loop:

        >>> for sample in samples:
        ...     do_something(sample)

    This returns a pair (chain state, sampling info) at each iteration. You can
    take advantage of this execution model for example for dynamic stopping or
    logging samples to be used in, say, tensorboard. No need for any callback
    logic.

    Called with its default values, the `run` method will be as fast as getting
    samples iteratively. We can however make it sensibly faster by calling

       >>> trace = sampler.run(1_000, accelerate=True)

    Behind the scene MCX replaces the for loop used internally (so it can
    display a progress bar) by JAX's `lax.scan`. The difference is most obvious
    for large models and number of samples.

    Finally, note that since the runtime keeps track of the last state it is possible
    to switch between the different execution models during sampling.

        generative model are provided as well as its output.
        2. Build and compile the loglikelihood from the model's logpdf and the
        observations. This can take some time for large datasets.

        deal with flat arrays.
