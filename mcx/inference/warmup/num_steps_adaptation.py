"""Adaptive algorithms for Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

This is a collection of re-usable adaptive schemes for monte carlo algorithms.
The algorithms are used during the warm-up phase of the inference and are
decorrelated from any particular algorithm (dynamic HMC's adaptive choice of
path length is not included, for instance).

The Stan Manual [1]_ is a very good reference on automatic tuning of
parameters used in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

    during the warmup phase we run this scheme many times in order to get a

    from this distribution during inference to use as the number of integration
