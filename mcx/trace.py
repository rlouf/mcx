class Trace(InferenceData):
    """Trace contains the data generated during inference.

    The class is a thin wrapper around ArviZ's `InferenceData`, an
    interface between the chains produced by the samplers and ArviZ.

    The sampler runs the inference kernel provided by the evaluator. This
    kernel produces information in that the evaluator translates into samples
    and sampling information. This information is used to initialize a Trace
    object:

    +---------+            +------------+              +------------+
    | Sampler | ---------> |  Evaluator | -----------> |   Trace    |
    +---------+  states    +------------+   samples    +------------+
                 info                       info
                 ravel_fn

    This design ensures that neither the sampler nor the Trace need to be aware
    of what evaluator was used. This avoids carrying branching logic to
    accomodate fundamentally different algorithms (such as HMC and Metropolis
    Hastings).

    Samples and informations are stored as dictionnary internally and we interface
    with ArviZ by mimicking the `InferenceData` class. The latter's attributes are
    implemented as properties which transform the internal format to xarrays. There
    are two reasons for this design choice:

    1. Having some flexibility in the trace format. We may want to extract
    information from the trace down the line, and having control over the trace
    format means we can tweak it to improve performance. The moment we use
    ArviZ's format we lose control over that.
    2. Translating the trace to an xarray "concretizes" the DeviceArray's
    values in RAM which we do not necessarily want to do right after sampling
    in case we would like to perform other operations.
    3. Name conventions are different and it would be confusing to support two
    conventions internally.

    Examples
    --------

    A trace is immediately created when sampling from a posterior distribution:

        >>> trace_warmup = sampler.warmup()
        >>> trace_sample = sampler.run()

    It is possible to concatenate traces in place:

        >>> trace = sampler.warmup()
        >>> trace += sampler.run()

    or to concatenate two traces:

        >>> trace_1 = sampler.run()
        >>> trace_2 = sampler.run()
        >>> trace = trace_1 + trace_2

    This allows, for instance, to take first a few samples to check for convergence and
    add more samples afterwards.

    The integration with ArviZ is seemless: MCX traces can be passed to ArviZ's
    diagnostics, statistics and plotting functions.

        >>> import arvix as az
        >>> az.plot_trace(trace)
